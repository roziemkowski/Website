<h1>Research Paper Toolbox</h1>

	<p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, 
	Technical Communication and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. </p>
	
	<p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the process 
	efficient and manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in writing a research paper, 
	as well as a selection of tools that complement certain steps.</p>

	experienced writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons. To begin, choose a lesson by clicking one of
